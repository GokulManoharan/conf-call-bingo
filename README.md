 Play the game in this [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/GokulManoharan/conf-call-bingo)


## Game rules
- A player wins by completing a row, column, or diagonal.
- There's a free slot (always on) in the middle
- You can have multiple bingos

## Packages used
#### `canvas-confetti` - To let the player see a visual reward
#### `react-bootstrap` - CSS Library for easy development of designs

## THE CHALLENGE

**Must haves:**

- Build a fully working Bingo App using ReactJS **respecting the 3 basic rules explained above**.
- The game **must** always fit nicely to any screen-size (e.g. mobile).
- **Design your own version** – our game is an example. Be creative and pick your own design!
- Having a bingo requires some **nice visual reward**. You don't need to use confetti – choose something you believe fits best.
- Think of multiple gamers playing the Bingo together.. ensure that winning the game is possible and fair. (hint: if every player has the same card, everybody would win)
